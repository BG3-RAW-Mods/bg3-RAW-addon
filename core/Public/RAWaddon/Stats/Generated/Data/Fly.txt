// Using Different Speeds
// If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds 
// during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. 
// The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.
// For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, 
// then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.
