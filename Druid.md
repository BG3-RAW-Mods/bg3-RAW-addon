## Shape Stats

Movement Speed is defined in meters.
Wild Shapes will now get hit points between min and max. For example, Dire Wolf has 37 Hit Points (5d10 + 10). Min is 15, Max is 60. Moon Druid can't have 37 at level 2, would be overpowered. And for other subclasses, 37 is rather low at level 8.

Passives:
- Keen Smell: Advantage on Perception rolls
- Feline Fall: Resistance to Fall Damage
- Pack Tactics: Has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the wolf's allies is within 1.5 meters of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

Ability DC: when a wildshape rolls a DC, it adds proficiency bonus to base number.
For example, Panther Pounce rolls DC 10. It will be:
- DC 12 for levels 1-4
- DC 13 for levels 5-8
- DC 14 for levels 9-12
- DC 15 for levels 13-15
- DC 16 for levels 16-20
