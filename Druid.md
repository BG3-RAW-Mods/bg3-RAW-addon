Some shapes are straight upgrades from lower ones and will be a replacement instead of an addition:
- Black Bear, Brown Bear, Polar Bear
- Wolf, Dire Wolf
- Giant Wolf Spider, Giant Spider
- Panther, Saber-Toothed Tiger, Spotted Lion
- Velociraptor, Ankylosaurus, Stegosaurus

Some shapes have been removed:
- Owlbear. It is a monstruosity, not allowed by druids
- Deep Rothe. I haven't found anything about this monster. Replaces by Giant Elk.
- Elemental Myrmidons. Druid can shape into Elementals at level 10, but not Myrmidons.

**I didn't add any new models or animations. I have used what was available. So there are several shapes that don't have the correct model but everything else is RAW.**

## Shape Stats

Movement Speed is defined in meters.
Wild Shapes will now get hit points between min and max. For example, Dire Wolf has 37 Hit Points (5d10 + 10). Min is 15, Max is 60. Moon Druid can't have 37 at level 2, would be overpowered. And for other subclasses, 37 is rather low at level 8.

Passives:
- Keen Smell. Advantage on Perception checks
- Keen Sight. Advantage on Perception checks
- Feline Fall. Resistance to Fall Damage
- Spider Fall. Resistance to Fall Damage
- Pack Tactics. Has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the wolf's allies is within 1.5 meters of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
- Web Walker. Ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.
- Blindsight. A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. 
- Rampage. When the attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, it can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.
- Flyby. Doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

Ability DC: when a wildshape rolls a DC, it adds proficiency bonus to base number.
For example, Panther Pounce rolls DC 10. It will be:
- DC 12 for levels 1-4
- DC 13 for levels 5-8
- DC 14 for levels 9-12
- DC 15 for levels 13-15
- DC 16 for levels 16-20

Some shapes have multi-attacks, typically bite-claws. They will get two attack skills and a multi-attack skill.

The notation "Recharge X- Y" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest. For the Giant Spider, that means you roll a d6 and if it comes up with 5 or 6, then it can use the web attack again.

*Note*: Recharge doesn't seem to work for players, so these abilities are available every turns.
