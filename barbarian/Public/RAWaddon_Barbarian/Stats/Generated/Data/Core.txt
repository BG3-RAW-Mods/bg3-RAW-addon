// Feral Instinct:
// you have advantage on initiative rolls and if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
// for the 1st part, can't give advantage to initiative, but +3 seems more or less the same
// for the 2nd part, it seems difficult to implement, immunity to surprise is cheap but probably the best we can get
